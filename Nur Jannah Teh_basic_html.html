	<em> Social Anxiety is the fear of social situation where the sufferer has the difficulties to sociolize with others in public.
Particularly, the fear of being judged and evaluated by others towards them. Their thoughts are always full of others opinion towards the way 
they walk, speak, their attires, behaviour and a bunch of others stuff related to theirself. However in reality, there is no one that judging them.
Most sufferers realise that they have unrealistic and constant fear of social situation but they find it difficult to get rid of it because the 
feeling is so real.

	<em> The sufferers of social anxiety may have symptoms such as shaking, heart beat race, sweating, nauseas, panic attack and having insomnia
caused by overthinking. Not all sufferers experience the same symptoms, it depends on the sufferers as well. Social anxiety has three stages, mild
moderate and severe. Social can be cured by cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) and medication (espran) mood stabilizer, this is the most 
effective way to cure social anxiety.

	<em> Social Anxiety sufferers still have the desire to socialize, live like a normal person where they make new friends, do some activities that they love,
join any favourite club and many more, the only things that holding them back is their anxiety, the thoughts of other make fun of them or the thoughts that they are 
not capable enough in achieving their goals that make them stay in their own safety zone. There are many reasons why someone suffer social anxiety, it can be from genetics,
childhood trauma, environment and many more.

	<b> In conclusion, social anxiety can live a normal life if they have a strong support system, as family and friends we need to give them assurance that everything is going to 
be alright and be understanding of their situation. It may takes time, but it is always worth to heal.
